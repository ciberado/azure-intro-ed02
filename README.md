# Azure introduction for developers

## Azure application architecture

The goal of this session will be to migrate an application to Azure, understanding basic identity concepts 
and resource organization. We will also introduce the most important services, 
including Storage Accounts, Virtual Networks, App Services, Azure Vault and Azure Database for Postgresql Flexible Server.

## Containers

During the second session, the team will transform the application into a container and will leverage several 
services to deploy it, starting with the Azure Container Registry. The App Service will be upgraded to take 
advantage of container images instead of barebones repositories.

## Automation

Manual deployment doesnâ€™t scale nor is reliable. This third session will be devoted to explain how to automatically 
manage infrastructure and the application lifecycle following GitOps practices. We will leverage Terraform and 
GitHub Actions for these task.

## Kubernetes

A containerized application will be a natural fit for Kubernetes. In this last session, we will introduce the basic concepts of 
the platform including namespaces, pods, services, replica sets, deployments and config maps. And we will see how to leverage 
them to simplify the lifecycle of the application.

## Observability

Once the application is running the journey has just begun. In this session, we will understand the state of the 
system by analyzing metrics, logs and traces. Also, we will explain how to automatically react to changes using autoscaling and self-healing.
